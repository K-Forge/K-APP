 * university grants an application registration, an Entra adapter is added beside
 * {@code LocalIdentityProvider} and no caller changes. Widening this signature - a
 * {@code createAccount}, a {@code Credential} return type, a password-hash parameter -
 * would quietly re-couple authentication to local storage and undo that.
 *
 * <p>Implementations are Spring beans; {@code AuthService} holds all of them and asks each
 * whether it {@link #supports(IdentityAssertion)} the assertion at hand.
