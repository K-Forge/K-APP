## Project Overview

**KApp** is the **mobile application** for the Fundación Universitaria Konrad Lorenz community, developed by the K-Forge club. The product vision is mobile-first: native Android (Kotlin) and iOS (Swift) clients that give students and staff access to academic management — courses, assignments, users, and authentication — from their phones.

The mobile clients are powered by a **Spring Boot microservices backend** behind a single gateway. Delivery is backend first, then mobile directly: the clients build against the hand-written OpenAPI contracts in `docs/api/`, served as Prism mocks, so client and server progress in parallel rather than in sequence. The old HTML/JS client was a prototype of the mobile layout and is frozen.

## Microservices

| Service | Port | Owns |
|---------|------|------|
| Discovery Server | 8761 | Eureka registry |
| API Gateway | 8080 | Routing, CORS, rate limiting. **No authentication logic** |
| Auth Service | 8081 | Credentials, RS256 signing, JWKS |
| User Service | 8082 | Profiles |
| Semaphore Service | 8083 | Academic catalogue, curricula, student progress |
| Schedule Service | 8084 | Student timetables |
| Map Service | 8085 | Buildings, floors, spaces |
| Common Library | — | Security and error auto-configuration |

All under `app/backend/microservices/`.

**Frozen, not deleted:** `course-service` and `assignment-service` remain in the tree but are
out of the reactor, the compose file and CI. They target PostgreSQL/JPA and are outside the MVP.
Do not build on them and do not re-add them to `<modules>`.

## Dev Commands

Full guide, including profiles, local accounts and troubleshooting:
**[docs/RUNBOOK.md](docs/RUNBOOK.md)**.

Requires JDK 21 and Docker. The repository pins the JDK with `.java-version` (jenv) and ships a
Maven wrapper, so use `./mvnw` rather than a system Maven.

```bash
cd app/backend/microservices

# Build and run every test. Tests use Testcontainers, so Docker must be running.
./mvnw -B verify

# One service only
./mvnw -B -pl map-service -am verify
```

Compose profiles exist so nobody has to run seven JVMs to work on one service:

```bash
cd app/backend/microservices

# Mobile / frontend work: the the Prism mocks alone. No JVM, no Mongo, ~200 MB.
docker compose --profile mock up -d      # ports 4010-4014

# Backend work: only what you need
docker compose --profile core up -d      # mongo, discovery, gateway, auth, user
docker compose --profile map up -d       # core + map-service
docker compose --profile academic up -d  # core + semaphore + schedule
docker compose --profile full up -d      # everything

docker compose --profile full down
```

Only the gateway (8080) is published. Reaching a service directly is meant to fail.

```bash
# Validate the API contracts the mobile clients build against
npx --package=@redocly/cli@latest redocly lint docs/api/*.yaml
```

## Conventions

### Java

- Use Lombok to reduce boilerplate.
- **Each service owns its own DTOs.** `common` holds only cross-cutting concerns: security
  auto-configuration, the `ApiError` envelope, domain exception types and `AcademicPeriod`.
  Shared DTOs were removed deliberately — they couple the services into a distributed monolith
  and make `common` a merge-conflict hotspot across parallel worktrees.
- Roles: `ROLE_GUEST`, `ROLE_STUDENT`, `ROLE_PROFESSOR`, `ROLE_ADMIN`. A guest is someone with no
  university account; they may read the campus map and nothing else.

### Security

- **Every service validates the token itself.** Each is an OAuth2 resource server checking RS256
  against `auth-service`'s JWKS. Bypassing the gateway therefore gains nothing — this is what
  closed finding S1. Never reintroduce identity headers such as `X-User-Email`.
- Configure with `jwk-set-uri`, **never** `issuer-uri`: the latter performs OIDC discovery at bean
  creation, so a service refuses to start unless auth-service is already up — a boot-order
  deadlock under `docker compose up`.
- Read identity through `CurrentUser` from `common`, never from a request header.
- The `roles` claim carries prefixed names (`ROLE_STUDENT`), so the authority prefix is empty.
  Adding `ROLE_` again yields `ROLE_ROLE_STUDENT` and every `hasRole` check fails silently.
- `POST /internal/**` is authenticated with a shared `X-Internal-Token` and has no gateway route.
- Never expose signing keys or DB credentials. Use environment variables.

### Database

- MongoDB, one database per service on one instance. Run it as a **single-node replica set**:
  a standalone `mongod` cannot do multi-document transactions and fails at runtime, not startup.
- **Schema changes go in Mongock change units**, never applied by hand. They are append-only:
  never edit one that has run, add a new one.
- Every service that touches MongoDB must carry `@EnableMongock`. Mongock 5.5.1 ships no
  auto-configuration, so without it migrations are skipped in silence.
- Academic periods use the university's own format, `YYYYS` (e.g. `20262`). Validate with
  `@ValidAcademicPeriod` from `common`.
- `app/database/init.sql` is the legacy PostgreSQL schema, kept for reference only.

### Inter-Service Communication

Three Feign edges. Keep the number small: every extra one is a new failure mode and a new
reason for a service to be unable to answer on its own.

```
Auth Service      → (Feign) → User Service       # create a profile at registration
Semaphore Service → (Feign) → User Service       # resolve the student's programme
Schedule Service  → (Feign) → Semaphore Service  # course catalogue, cached 1h
```

**None of them sits on a hot path**, which is the property that makes three acceptable. The first
two fire once per account; the third reads near-static reference data through a cache, so
`schedule-service` keeps working while `semaphore-service` is briefly down.

Services are discovered by name via Eureka. The caller's token is propagated automatically by
`common`; registration is the exception, since no user token exists yet — that call carries a
shared internal secret and has no gateway route.

> **Open decision.** `semaphore → user` exists only to read `programCode` when a student's progress
> document is first created; afterwards the value is stored. Carrying `programCode` as a JWT claim
> would remove the edge entirely, at the cost of requiring a fresh sign-in after a programme change.
> Recorded rather than resolved: it was added without a decision, and it should have one.

### Git

- **Commits:** Conventional Commits, English, lowercase, no scope, no final period.
  ```
  feat: add course enrollment endpoint
  fix: resolve jwt expiry handling
  chore: update spring boot to 3.2.5
  ```
- **Branches:** Git Flow — `main`, `develop`, `feature/*`, `bugfix/*`, `test/*`, `hotfix/*`, `release/*`.

### Versioning

SemVer `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. Release cycle: alpha → beta → stable.

## Current State

Read `docs/PROGRESS.md` for up-to-date implementation status before proposing large changes.

- **Backend:** seven services on MongoDB. The Phase 0 skeleton is complete and verified — the full
  reactor builds with integration tests on Testcontainers. Domain logic for registration, the
  catalogue, progress, timetables and the map is the work in progress.
- **API contract:** five hand-written OpenAPI specs in `docs/api/`, served as Prism mocks. This is
  the source of truth. Write the spec first; springdoc output is a drift check against it, not the
  other way round.
- **Mobile (the product, in progress):** Kotlin and Swift clients, built against the mocks.
- **Web:** the old HTML/JS client was a prototype of the mobile design and is frozen. There is no
  Angular app; the planned one is an admin UI for preloaded data, not a student-facing client.

---

## Roadmap

MVP scope is users, campus map, customisable preloaded schedule and customisable preloaded career
semaforo. Everything else is deferred. Keep this list in sync with `docs/PROGRESS.md`.

1. Registration: institutional e-mail, verification, invitation codes, and guest sign-up.
2. Academic catalogue and curricula, seeded from the published Ingenieria de Sistemas pensum.
3. Student progress with prerequisite-aware eligibility.
4. Timetables built from the student's curriculum, with manual day, time, room and group.
5. Campus map: buildings, floor plans and space search.
6. Kotlin (Android) and Swift (iOS) clients — the product.
7. Angular admin UI for managing preloaded data.
8. Entra ID adapter behind `IdentityProviderPort`, once the university grants a registration.
9. Deployment on university hardware: multi-architecture images, TLS, backups.
10. Deferred: refresh tokens and logout, Config Server, distributed tracing, Redis-backed rate
    limiting, database-per-service, Kubernetes.

## AI Agent Instructions

- **Never modify** `.env` files (contains secrets).
- **Backend location:** all backend work goes in `app/backend/microservices/`. The original monolith was deleted once the migration completed; it is only retrievable from the git history and must not be resurrected.
- **Schema:** Modify `app/database/init.sql` carefully. Align data types with existing structures.
- **Before large changes:** Read `docs/PROGRESS.md` and the contribution guidelines published by the K-Forge organization first.
- **Product identity:** KApp is a **mobile app** for Konrad Lorenz. The microservices are the backend that powers the mobile clients. Do not describe KApp as a "web platform" — it is a mobile-first product.
- **Demo mode:** `app/frontend/web/js/demo.js` intercepts API calls with sample data and activates only when the client is served from a host other than `localhost` (or forced with `?demo=1`). It exists so the interface can be deployed statically while no backend is hosted. Never point it at real data, and never let it change behaviour during local development.
- **Delivery sequence:** backend first, then **mobile directly**. The web client was a prototype of
  the mobile layout and is frozen; it is not a step on the path any more. The clients are built
  against the OpenAPI mocks rather than against a finished backend, which is what lets client and
  server work proceed at the same time.
- **Contract first.** Changing a request or response shape means editing `docs/api/*.openapi.yaml`
  first — four people are building against those mocks. CI lints them on every push.
- **No emojis** in technical markdown documents.
- **No automatic commits.** Present changes for review first.
- **Documentation language:** English for repository documentation.

## Temporary Files

- `tmp/` is gitignored. Store one-off scripts and throwaway files there.
- Delete after use. Never commit anything from `tmp/`.
